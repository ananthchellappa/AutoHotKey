# AutoHotKey

The script that has boosted my productivity immensely for the last ten years.

How to use :

Put the EasyWindowDrag_KDE.ahk script in your Startup folder (fire up Windows File Explorer and just type startup).
Put the Notify.ahk anywhere and edit the EasyWindowDrag_KDE.ahk to give it the correct path to the Notify.

And you're in business. Enjoy the productivity boost! Thank the genius who wrote that script to mimic KDE's drag/resize.
